        Please place your finger on the device\'s camera, covering the flash as well.\nAfter
        10 seconds, you can export the results with the Share button. \n\nThis utility works
        by measuring the amount of red it sees through the camera, and attempting to detect the
        fluctuations. \nIt works better in a darkened room, and when the pressure on the camera
        is constant. \nIn case there are multiple cameras on your device, make sure that most your
